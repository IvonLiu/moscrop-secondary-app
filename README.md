********** Dependencies **********

All dependencies are configured correctly already. Some dependencies are in git submodules. These will be updated automatically (see section on updating below) and are relatively hassle-free. Others you will need to install beforehand. So far, the dependencies you will need to install separately are:

[android-support-v7-appcompat](https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html)

Also, be sure to have build tools v21 or higher installed and have SDK and support repositories updated to version 21 or newer.

********** Cloning repository to local **********

This requires a few extra steps due to git submodules. Rest assured, these are very simple steps, and will save you/me a lot of work in the long run.

Clone (SSH):

```
#!bash

git clone git@bitbucket.org:IvonLiu/moscrop-secondary-app.git
```

Clone (HTTPS):

```
#!bash

git clone https://IvonLiu@bitbucket.org/IvonLiu/moscrop-secondary-app.git
```

Configure submodules:

```
#!bash

git submodule init
git submodule update
```

That's it! Now you can import the project to Android Studio and everything should work correctly. 

********** Updating **********

Again, there are a few extra steps due to submodules. Again, totally worth it.

Update main repository:

```
#!bash

git pull origin master
```

Update submodules:

```
#!bash

git submodule update
```

NOTE: This step is only necessary if you see that one or more submodules have been modified when updating the main repository. If no submodules have been modified, you may skip this step. If you are unsure whether a submodule has been modified or not, perform this step anyway. 

Both the main repository and all submodules should be up to date.

********** Troubleshooting **********

If you get this error

```
#!bash

$ git submodule update
fatal: reference isnâ€™t a tree: 6c5e70b984a60b3cecd395edd5b48a7575bf58e0
Unable to checkout '6c5e70b984a60b3cecd395edd5ba7575bf58e0' in submodule path 'foo'
```

That means that the main repository is referencing a submodule commit that the author did not push to this remote repository. In the event this occurs, follow the instructions provided by the official git documentations:

> You have to see who last changed the submodule  
> Then, you e-mail that guy and yell at him.
