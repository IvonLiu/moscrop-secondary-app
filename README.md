The project is dependent on a few additional libraries. One of them is android-support-v7-appcompat, which you can download using Android's SDK Manager. This guide will teach you how to set that up: https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html

The other library needed is android-rss. I forked the original project on github and added caching of feeds so it's more suitable for this app. You can fine that here: https://github.com/IvonLiu/android-rss
